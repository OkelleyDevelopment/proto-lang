# Proto-Lang

Author(s): Nicholas O'Kelley

Date: A period between May and June, 2022

## Motivation

In the effort to "mock up" the work needed to complete a personal project rewrite,
this project exists to show the simplest implementation that will help catalyst
the other one!

## Project Execution

```
cargo run
```

You will see some basic output in the terminal.

## Known Bugs

- Not exhaustive, though that is more a limitation than a bug

While this next one did not immediately affect this project, it was an interesting read
and has influenced my thinking so I leave it for others to explore too.
